# basescore
Assistant for aiding Judges for entering Mogul Base Score


Use this tool if entering into all 3 Turns categories

Use the 3 sliders for Carving, Abs/Ext and Upper Body to refine your score, then total Base Score shown at top of the page

- This tool will work with PC, MAC, Android and Apple and will work in Portrait or Landscape mode.
- Sliders should work just fine with Mouse, Touch screen. 
- Arrow Up/Down keys on the screen can be held for fast adjustment, or single press Up/Down for fine-tuning by 0.1 point.
- Alternatively in PC and MAC the PgUp/PgDn and Left-Arrow, Right-Arrow keys will perform similar adjustments.

Take and look and give me some feedback.

Alternatively there is a more advanced tool that allows entry of Base Score directly with breakdown into each of the 3 Turns Categories & subsequent fine tuning of each category.
